# Basic Operation
- **Case 1: Vin=0 (logic 0)**
  - Here PMOS is ON (Saturation region) and acts as a Current Source.
  - NMOS is OFF (cutoff).
- **Case 2: Vin=VDD (logic 1)**
   - Here NMOS is ON (saturation region).
   - PMOS is OFF (cutoff).

- The NMOS acts as a Open Circuit and PMOS acts as a resistor (short circuit for Ideal Case), this enables the Load Capacitor to get Charged with time constant(ùúè=RpCL).
- The PMOS acts as a Open Circuit and NMOS acts as a resistor (short circuit for Ideal Case), this enables the Load Capacitor to get Discharged with time constant(ùúè=RnCL).

- Here ID is horizontally Siftef over VDD

- Governing Equation
  - IDSp = -IDSn
  - VGn = Vin
  - VGSp = Vin - VDD
  - VDSn = Vout
  - VDSp = Vout - VDD

</p>
- The points where both NMOS ans PMOS Voltages will be same , the current will also be same in magnitude with relation IDSp = -IDSn

# Major Issues 
- Noise Margin
- Inverter Delay
    - Propagation Delay
- How to Improve Design Technique ?
  - Reduce Load Capacitance
  - Increase Transistor sizing
  - Increase VDD (Power Consumption)
