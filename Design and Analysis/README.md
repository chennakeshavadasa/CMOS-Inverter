# Basic Operation
- **Case 1: Vin=0 (logic 0)**
  - Here PMOS is ON (Saturation region) and acts as a Current Source.
  - NMOS is OFF (cutoff).
  - The NMOS acts as a Open Circuit and PMOS acts as a resistor (short circuit for Ideal Case), this enables the Load Capacitor to get Charged with time constant(ùúè=RpCL).
- **Case 2: Vin=VDD (logic 1)**
   - Here NMOS is ON (saturation region).
   - PMOS is OFF (cutoff).
  - The PMOS acts as a Open Circuit and NMOS acts as a resistor (short circuit for Ideal Case), this enables the Load Capacitor to get Discharged with time constant(ùúè=RnCL).

# Major Issues 
- Noise Margin
- Inverter Delay
    - Propagation Delay
      - Calculation of Overall capacitance  
- How to Improve Design Technique ?
  - Reduce Load Capacitance
  - Increase Transistor sizing
  - Increase VDD (Power Consumption)
