# Basic Operation
- **Case 1: Vin=0 (logic 0)**
  - Here PMOS is ON (Saturation region) and acts as a Current Source.
  - NMOS is OFF (cutoff).
- **Case 2: Vin=VDD (logic 1)**
   - Here NMOS is ON (saturation region).
   - PMOS is OFF (cutoff).

- The NMOS acts as a Open Circuit and PMOS acts as a resistor (short circuit for Ideal Case), this enables the Load Capacitor to get Charged with time constant(ùúè=RpCL).
- The PMOS acts as a Open Circuit and NMOS acts as a resistor (short circuit for Ideal Case), this enables the Load Capacitor to get Discharged with time constant(ùúè=RnCL).
